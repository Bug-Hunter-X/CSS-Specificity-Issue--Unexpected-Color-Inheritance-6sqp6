The following CSS code snippet demonstrates an uncommon error related to the specificity of CSS selectors:

```css
div {
  color: blue;
}

.special div {
  color: red;
}

#id div {
  color: green;
}

#id .special div {
  color: purple; 
}

#id .special div span {
  color: yellow; /* This will take precedence */
}
```

The unexpected behavior occurs when trying to predict the color of a `span` element nested within a `div` that has multiple classes and an ID.  Due to the specificity rules of CSS, the most specific selector (`#id .special div span`) takes precedence, resulting in yellow text, even though less specific rules exist.  Developers might mistakenly assume that rules defined earlier take precedence, overlooking the impact of specificity.

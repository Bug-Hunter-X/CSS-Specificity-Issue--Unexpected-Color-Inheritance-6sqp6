The solution involves understanding CSS specificity and adjusting the order of the selectors.  In some cases, restructuring the CSS or using the `!important` flag might be necessary.  However, overusing `!important` should be avoided as it can lead to maintainability issues.  It's crucial to understand how specificity works to effectively manage styling conflicts:

```css
div {
  color: blue;
}

.special div {
  color: red;
}

#id div {
  color: green;
}

#id .special div {
  color: purple; 
}

/* In this version, we explicitly target the span for yellow color */
#id .special div span {
  color: yellow; 
}
```

This updated CSS will produce the expected outcome as it addresses the issue without using the `!important` tag which should be used only when necessary.
